### Introduce Yourself

I am Snow a seasoned software developer with 6-10 years of experience, specializing in backend development, database management, and legacy system integration. While I am not currently working on any projects involving dApps or Web3 technologies, my focus remains on mastering traditional software development methodologies and optimizing centralized systems. I am particularly skilled in Python, Go, and SQL, and I am interested in part-time or project-based collaboration opportunities. My expertise lies in creating efficient and reliable solutions for legacy systems and database driven applications.
